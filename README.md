## ⚠️ Known Issues / Current Status

I'm currently working on integrating example scenes and prefabs.

**Important Note:** The Unity Package Manager is not yet correctly recognizing the **Samples** folder structure. If you need to access the demonstration assets (scenes, prefabs, etc.):

1.  Go to https://github.com/WellingtonDePaula/dialogue-system.
2.  Manually **copy** the contents of the `Prefabs` folder or `Scenes` folder into your project's main **`Assets`** folder.
